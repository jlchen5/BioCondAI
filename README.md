# BioCondAI: Biological Condensates Analysis Tool

BioCondAI is an open-source project aimed at utilizing artificial intelligence to assist researchers in analyzing and predicting the behavior of biological condensates. This tool combines multi-dimensional features of biological data and applies machine learning methods to provide in-depth insights into the formation, functions, and roles of condensates in diseases.

## Features

- **Data Integration**: Integrates biological small molecule data from various sources, including protein interactions, nucleic acid sequences, and more.
- **Condensate Prediction**: Utilizes machine learning models to predict the formation of condensates under various conditions.
- **Functional Analysis**: Offers tools to analyze the potential biological functions of condensates and their roles in diseases.
- **Interactive Interface**: Provides a user-friendly interface allowing researchers to easily upload data and interpret results.
- **Educational Resources**: Supplies resources to help users understand the biological background of condensates and the methods for data analysis.
